**************************************************************************************

Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google

********************************

Downloading jQuery

There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)

Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

********************************
jQuery CDN

If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.

One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google or Microsoft:

Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google or Microsoft when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
